;;; Commentary:

;; Provides two rings `pointhistory-ring' and `pointhistory-auto-ring'
;; for remembering positions of point.
;; If a command moves point over a long distance. The previous point position
;; is stored in `pointhistory-auto-ring'.
;; You can return to these point positions by the command `pointhistory-auto-backward' (bound to M-S-up).
;; This is most useful if you accidently moved point and want to return to the previous position.
;;
;; If you want to remember a point position for later use you can call pointhistory-point2ring (bound to M-+).
;; Press M-up to rotate through the remembered point positions.

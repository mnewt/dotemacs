;;; early-init.el --- Emacs early init -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs 27 introduced early-init.el, which is run before init.el, before
;; package and UI initialization happens.

;;; Code:

(defconst emacs-start-time (current-time))

;; Uncomment this to debug.
;; (setq init-file-debug t)
;; (setq messages-buffer-max-lines 100000)

;; If an `.el' file is newer than its corresponding `.elc', load the `.el'.
(setq load-prefer-newer t)

;; Set Garbage Collection threshold to 1GB, run GC on idle.
(setq gc-cons-threshold 1073741824
      gc-cons-percentage 0.6)

;; Write any customizations to a temp file so they are discarded.
(setq custom-file (make-temp-file "custom-" nil ".el"))

;; Faster to disable these here (before they've been initialized)

;; Give the frame basic coloring while waiting for the theme to load. The main
;; purpose of this is to not blind me when it's dark by flashing a screen full
;; of white. These colors are from doom-one.

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.

;; These are good notes on optimizing startup performance:
;; https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/wiki/FAQ#how-is-dooms-startup-so-fast

;; Unset `file-name-handler-alist' too (temporarily). Every file opened and
;; loaded by Emacs will run through this list to check for a proper handler for
;; the file, but during startup, it wonâ€™t need any of them.

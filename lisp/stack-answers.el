;;; Commentary:

;; Get quick answers to questions without leaving Emacs, using Stack Exchange.
;; Based on the idea from:
;; https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cs6cb4/instant_stackoverflow_solutions_in_emacs_without/

;;;; TODO:
;; - Hide entire section, not just the block
;; - org-cycle type section cycling
;; - Replace unicode sequences in all shr rendered regions. Need to figure out
;;how to replace text and preserve text properties.
;; - The first request never completes...?

;;; Code:

If nil, then don't show any indicators.
Otherwise the value has to have one of these two forms:

(EXPANDABLE-BITMAP . COLLAPSIBLE-BITMAP)

  Both values have to be variables whose values are fringe
  bitmaps.  In this case every section that can be expanded or
  collapsed gets an indicator in the left fringe.

  To provide extra padding around the indicator, set
  `left-fringe-width' in `stack-answers-mode-hook'.

(STRING . BOOLEAN)

  In this case STRING (usually an ellipsis) is shown at the end
  of the heading of every collapsed section.  Expanded sections
  get no indicator.  The cdr controls whether the appearance of
  these ellipsis take section highlighting into account.  Doing
  so might potentially have an impact on performance, while not
  doing so is kinda ugly."
